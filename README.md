This is a fork of https://github.com/tinic/ESP32_ArtNetNode

To compile get the latest version of the Arduino environment: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

Post install in the Arduino IDE to get a working ESP32 environment:

2. Go to Tools -> Board: XXX -> Boards Manager and  search for ESP32. Install it. Version 1.0.2 is known to work.
3. Go to Tools -> Manage Libraries. Search for 'ArduinoJson' (without an underscore) and install version 5.13.5 (later versions do NOT work).
4. Go to Tools -> Boards: XXX and select "OLIMEX ESP32-PoE" in the ESP32 section.
